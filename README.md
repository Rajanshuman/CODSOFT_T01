Number Game 
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
You can incorporate additional details as follows:
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

:-- Number guessing games are a great way to practice programming fundamentals, such as user input handling, random number generation, and control flow. Let’s dive into various aspects of implementing a number guessing game in Java, along with some enhancements and variations.
*BASIC CONCEPT* 
Random Number Generation:

We’ll use java.util.Random or Math.random() to generate a random number within a specified range.
User Input Handling:

Use Scanner from java.util.Scanner to get input from the user.
Control Flow:

Use if-else statements to compare the user’s guess with the randomly generated number.
Use loops to allow multiple guesses until the correct number is guessed.
